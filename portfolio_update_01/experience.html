          <p class="hd">Certified Paralegal - 4 Years</p>
          <p>I worked as a paralegal at an Intellectual Property firm, assisting the attorneys with cases regarding patent, trademark and copyright law on the federal level.  My strengths were in technical writing and research. I gained an abundance of knowlege regarding the legal side of the tech world.</p>

            <p class="hd">Project Manager - 2 years</p>
            <p> I had left the legal field to pursue project management for a tech company in Washington DC. I took the knowlege I had gained during my years of being a paralegal, and found I enjoyed the project management side of the job a lot more than the research side. Creating deadlines, monitoring time spent on each case. That led me to taking a few certification in project management, ultimatly changing career paths. </p>
